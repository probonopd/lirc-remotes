# brand: UEI aka Universal Electronics Inc.
# model no. of remote control:  Atlas DVR-1055 aka DVR(day)-1055
# devices being controlled by this remote:  Shaw/Motorola DCT-2500, DCT-6416, and others.

# see also: http://www.urcsupport.com/
# This remote is re-branded, customized (e.g. ShawOnDemand button), and sold
# for use with Digital Cable Terminal's and PVR's by: Shaw Communications
# Inc. (a Canadian cable company)

# Since a DCT has no volume control the remote (as shipped) controls the TV
# volume. That is, even when the remote is in "Cbl" mode the Volume/Mute
# buttons always control the TV volume. Unfortunately the TV Manufacturer Code
# selected by Shaw is 0047 which LIRC can only handle in "raw" mode (in my
# experience the performance of "raw" modes isn't as good). Two workaround's
# are possible: change the TV Manufacturer Code or change the Volume Lock to
# use another device. I chose the latter route and chose to use the "Aud"
# device. Read the manual for instruction on changing the Volume Lock.

# For a complete MythTV solution append this file to dvr-1055_cbl and
# comment out all the Aud buttons except the Vol+, Vol-, and Mute.

# This file documents the "Aud" mode. The manual states that this is for a
# Pioneer audio receiver. The manufacturer code is 1023.
