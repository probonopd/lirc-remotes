# brand: Sony
# model no. of remote control: RMT-B101A
# devices being controlled by this remote: Sony BDP-S301 Blu-ray player
#
# I derived and normalized these codes manually from an iPronto ICF
# file contributed to remotecentral.com by Robert Scott.  Please note
# the following minor caveats:
#
# 1. The PLAY_MODE code from the ICF file seems to be incorrect,
#    so I've commented it out below.
# 2. I've only tested this with transmitting, not receiving.
# 3. The Sony function codes seem to be stored LSB-first, so the
#    function codes below are actually the 7-bit reverse of the
#    "proper" numbers.  This doesn't matter, unless you're trying
#    to find some pattern in the codes -- i.e. the numeric buttons
#    1-9,0 use the Sony codes 0,1,2,3,... while the reversed,
#    LIRC-friendly codes are 0,64,32,96,...
