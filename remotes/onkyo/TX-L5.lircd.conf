# This is the config file for the Onkyo TX-L5 receiver.
# The Remote interactive input/output can be
# hooked up to the serial port like this:
#
#                     +----|<|-----------------o DTR 
#                     |    D1 (1N4148)
#           R2 (10k) | |
#                    | |
#                     |
# RI phone jack  +----+-----------------+------o DCD
# (mono, 3.5mm) /     |                 |
#          ____/     | | R1 (10k) +-|>|-+
#         /   /     | |	  | D2 (5V1 zenerdiode)
#        (  ()  )     |           |
#         ____/------+-----------+------------o GND
#
#
# The remote interactive connection is an input
# and a pnp open collector output.
# With this schematic you can both send and
# receive over the same wire.
# If sending doesn't work try decreasing the value
# of R2 (look at the signal with a scope
# if you have one).
# So far I have only discovered the values of
# setting the MD, DVD and HD inputs.
# Once I have discovered the rest of the values
# this file will be updated.
#
# I have also discovered a reset value and some
# test modes.
# DO NOT TRY THESE!!!
# When I tried these the s/pdif inputs stopped
# working and I had to reset the amp by holding
# the subwoofer mode button and pressing the
# standby/on button.
#
# So here they are in decimal format:

#1056	reset
#1057	TEST- 1 -00
#1058	TEST- 2 -00
#1059	TEST- 3 -00
#1060	TEST- 4 -00	test tone couple 100 hertz
#1061	TEST- 4 -01	test tone 30 hertz or so
#1062	TEST- 4 -02
#1063	TEST- 4 -03	test tone couple 100 hertz
#1064	TEST- 4 -04	test tone couple 1000 hertz hurts your ears
#1065	TEST- 4 -05	test tone couple 1000 hertz hurts your ears
#1066	TEST- 4 -06	test tone couple 1000 hertz hurts your ears
#1067	TEST- 4 -07	test tone couple 1000 hertz hurts your ears
#1068	TEST- 4 -08	test tone couple 1000 hertz hurts your ears
#1069	TEST- 4 -09	test tone couple 1000 hertz hurts your ears
#1070	TEST- 4 -00	test tone couple 100 hertz
#1071	TEST- 4 - 10	test tone couple 100 hertz cycles through the test modes
