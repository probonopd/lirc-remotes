# brand:                       LG
# model no. of remote control: N/A
# devices being controlled by this remote: many LG VCRs
#
# This remote is sold as part of many LG VCR packages -- mine is a
# VF28, it might also be known as an EC281S. It controls most
# features of the VCR, and can also send some basic TV codes if
# you have an LG TV. It uses the NEC encoding, so it is unlikely
# you will be able to use it to control devices other than LG
# VCRs.
#
# The remote has two modes: Video (VCR) and TV. You switch between
# the modes by pressing the appropriate key near the top of the
# remote. Those two keys send no code to the devices, they just
# change the mode of the remote.
#
# The timings and protocol information for the NEC encoding were
# obtained from http://www.ustr.net/infrared/nec.shtml
# This helped me ensure that the information below is accurate and
# can be used as a basis for other NEC-encoded remotes. I had to
# increase the eps to 60% before the remote could be read by my
# SIR dongle. The gap was measured with xmode2, and tuned to get
# better key repeats.
