# model no. of remote control:   RCU600M
# devices being controlled by this remote: configured for RePlay DVR
#
#  First: I wanted something that for a not too expensive remote,
#  (I think I got this at a local discount store, though I've seen it
#  at larger department stores) but I wanted proper button selection.
#  This is a nice remote with a backlight function, seperate
#  directional keys from the volume keys, and all the other dvd
#  functions (chapter skip for example, was missing on some other
#  remotes I looked at).
#
#  I had to find a code for this universal remote that would activate
#  almost all the buttons, since many codes left buttons inactive.
#  In case you lost your book, hold your *code search* button until
#  the LED stays on red, then *VCR* and enter "316".  This one worked
#  well enough to end my search.  The "enter" and "OK" buttons on the
#  remote seem to transmit the same data, the CH+ and CH- have small
#  >>| and |<< symbols next to them so they are assigned chapter skip
#  in my config.  At the bottom of the remote, PIP, SWAP, and SLEEP
#  do not seem to work, but input does.   Vol+, Vol-, and mute seem
#  to work slightly different than the rest of the buttons, so I got
#  them to work seperately.  Play with irw, edit config or whatever.
#
#  Please enjoy.
