# This file is for the RMT-D129A Sony remote. It has a TV mode that it can
# use to control various television sets, for basic functions of a TV. The
# manual that came with the Sony DVP-NS700P DVD player provides a list of
# TV manufacturer codes that can enter into the remote to set the TV mode
# for. This file does not contain any of that information, or LIRC
# recordings of the remote while in that mode.
